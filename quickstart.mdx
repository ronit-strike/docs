## Get Started with the Strike API

The Strike API empowers you to interact completely through our endpointsâ€”allowing you to place bets, manage your portfolio, and monitor your positions in real time. With our innovative system, you can execute over/under bets with a purchased multiplier, enabling continuous payouts and advanced risk management strategies like hedging.

### Obtain Your API Key

Before you can start interacting with our API, you'll need to generate your API key:

1. **Log in to the Strike Web App:**  
   Visit [https://dashboard.strike.com](https://dashboard.strike.com) and sign in with your credentials.

2. **Access the Developer Dashboard:**  
   Once logged in, navigate to the Developer Dashboard.

3. **Create an API Key:**  
   Click on "Create API Key" to generate your unique key. This key is required for every API request and must be included in the `X-API-Key` header.

4. **Manage Your API Key:**  
   You can revoke or regenerate your API key at any time directly from the Developer Dashboard.

### Interact with the API

Every API call requires your API key in the `X-API-Key` header. You can test our endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or integrate them directly into your application.

For example, to retrieve the latest betting events, you can use:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.strike.com/api/events" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
