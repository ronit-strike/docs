## Welcome to Strike

At **Strike**, we’re revolutionizing sports betting by transforming it into a dynamic asset class. Rather than the traditional fixed-odds model, Strike allows you to take an over or under on a line with a purchased multiplier. For every point above the line on an over bet (or below on an under bet), you gain a payout multiplied by your chosen multiplier. Conversely, if the outcome goes against your bet, you lose a multiplier amount per point. This continuous payout system not only limits your risk but also opens the door to sophisticated betting strategies such as hedging and dynamic portfolio management.

With the Strike API, developers can easily integrate these advanced betting features into their applications. Our endpoints empower you to:
- **Place and Manage Bets:** Execute over/under bets with precise risk controls.
- **Monitor Your Portfolio:** Track your betting positions and real-time exposures.
- **Hedge Strategically:** Implement complex hedging strategies to secure gains.
- **Analyze Performance:** Access comprehensive stats and analytics to refine your strategy.

## Getting Started

Integrating with the Strike API gives you the flexibility to build cutting-edge sports betting applications and manage your betting portfolio seamlessly. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, our documentation guides you through every step of the process.
