## Welcome to Strike

At **Strike**, we’re revolutionizing sports betting by transforming it into a dynamic asset class. Rather than the traditional fixed-odds model, Strike allows you to take an over or under on a line with a purchased multiplier. For every point above the line on an over bet (or below on an under bet), you gain a payout multiplied by your chosen multiplier. Conversely, if the outcome goes against your bet, you lose a multiplier amount per point. This continuous payout system not only limits your risk but also opens the door to sophisticated betting strategies such as hedging and dynamic portfolio management.

Our innovative platform empowers users to place, manage, and analyze sports bets in a dynamic, intuitive environment. Whether you're building a new application or integrating sports betting features into your existing platform, our API provides you with robust tools for:
- **Place and Manage Bets:** Execute over/under bets with precise risk controls.
- **Monitor Your Portfolio:** Track your betting positions and real-time exposures.
- **Hedge Strategically:** Implement complex hedging strategies to secure gains.
- **Analyze Performance:** Access comprehensive stats and analytics to refine your strategy.

This documentation is powered by our OpenAPI specification, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive reference for every endpoint, including:
- **Betting Events:** Retrieve upcoming or past betting events with flexible filtering options.
- **Players:** Access detailed information about athletes, including stats and profiles.
- **Lineups & Bets:** Create and manage lineups, placing sports bets with validation and risk management.
- **Payments & Withdrawals:** Handle financial transactions securely and efficiently.
- **Player Statistics:** Retrieve comprehensive statistics to help inform your betting strategies.
