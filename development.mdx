## Contributing to Strike

At **Strike**, we believe in the power of open source and welcome contributions from developers like you. Our platform is designed to transform sports betting into a dynamic asset class, and we’d love for you to help shape its future. Whether you want to build tutorials, develop new use cases, or even join our team, we’re excited to collaborate with the community.

Here are some example ideas for tutorials and projects you could create:
- **Building a Custom Betting Dashboard:** Create a front-end dashboard that integrates the Strike API to display real-time betting events and portfolio performance.
- **Implementing Advanced Hedging Strategies:** Develop a guide on how to use our continuous payout system to implement dynamic hedging and risk management strategies.
- **Real-Time Analytics Integration:** Showcase how to integrate the Strike API with analytics tools for live monitoring and performance analysis.
- **API Key Management Best Practices:** Create a tutorial on securely managing and revoking API keys through our Developer Dashboard.
- **Automated Betting Strategies:** Demonstrate how to build and automate betting strategies using the Strike API along with external data sources.
